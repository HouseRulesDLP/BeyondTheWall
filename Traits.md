# Character Traits

Characters get their first trait at level 2 and additional traits are learned at levels 6 & 10.  This is a change from the core rules which grant traits at levels 1, 5 & 9.  This was done to spread out the levels at which character gain upgrades rather than overloading the odd levels as the core rules do.

The traits from the core rules work largely as given.  Only new and changed traits are listed in this document.

Unless otherwise specified, each trait may only be taken once.

## Alignment Traits

### Changed Traits

When this trait is taken it automatically applies to the opposite alignment (thus Neutral characters cannot take this Trait).  Their blows are filled with the power of their allegiance and thus grant +2 to hit and damage against supernatural creatures of the named Alignment.  They also count as magical for overcoming immunities and resistances.  After scoring a hit against such a creature, this character may spend a Fortune Point to have their attack automatically do maximum damage.

#### Defender of the Balance

#### Eternal Hero
removed

#### Touched by Chaos
A couple of the example entries are modified:<br/>
**Psychic Vampirism** - Roll an extra Hit Die after completing a Short or Long Rest in the presence of others.<br/>
**Strange Eyes** - Character gains Low-Light vision if they do not already have it.  If they do, they gain Dark Vision.

#### Warrior of Law
Replaced by [Breaker](#breaker).

### New Traits

#### Fate's Witness
Characters must be of Lawful alignment to take this trait. When this character witnesses an oath or makes one herself, fate binds the oath taker to see it done. Anyone who makes an oath in her presence, including the character herself, must keep their word or find themselves halving all healing received and unable to regain Fortune Points unless they are working towards fulfilling their oath.

#### Rebuke
When this trait is taken, the character must select Law or Chaos and cannot be of that alignment.  
This character’s very presence is an anathema to supernatural creatures of the selected alignment.  This character may use their action to attempt to drive off such supernatural creatures.  Any such creatures able to see and hear the character must pass a Will saving throw with the character's CHA Mod and Level as a penalty.  Any creatures that fails become Frightened of the character for the next minute.  If the save is failed by 5 or more, the condition lasts 24 hours.  Once a given creature has passed its saving throw against this ability, it becomes immune to this ability from this character for the next 24 hours.  A character using this ability may spend a Fortune Point to impose Disadvantage on the saving throw.  This trait may be taken twice by Neutral characters (once for Law and once for Chaos).

#### Warded
When this trait is selected, either Chaos or Law must be chosen and the character cannot be of that alignment.  This character has Advantage on all saving throws to defend against the magical powers of creatures of the named alignment.  If such a saving throw is failed, this character may spend a Fortune Point to turn that failure into a success.  This trait may be taken twice by Neutral characters (once for Law and once for Chaos).

## Combat Traits

#### Combat Mastery
This character’s skill at arms is unmatched. If her level is greater than the hit dice of her strongest opponent, she gains +2 on all to-hit rolls and +2 armor class.

#### Distracting Fighter

#### Favored Enemy
This trait may be taken multiple times, gaining a different favored enemy each time.

#### Fighting Finesse
removed

#### Mighty Shot
removed

#### Shield Fighter
removed.  See the [Shield Master](Fighter.md#knacks) warrior knack and the Shields Shall Be Splintered rule.

#### Unarmed Combat 
The character is dangerous even without a weapon in her hand. This character does 1d6b damage with unarmed attacks.

### New Traits

#### Crossbow Expert
This character has spent long hours practicing with crossbows.  Reloading a crossbow may be performed with a Move action in place of a Main action, and you can attack adjacent foes or fire into melee with your crossbow without penalty.

#### Intelligent Fighter
This character watches her opponents carefully and learns how they fight.  She may add her Intelligence bonus to her AC so long as she is not wearing medium or heavy armor.  Cannot be combined with [Distracting Fighter](#distracting-fighter).

#### Mage Slayer

#### Off-Hand Proficiency
This character may wield a medium one-handed weapon in their off-hand at the same time as they wield a medium one-handed weapon in their primary hand.  While wielding two weapons, this character gains a +1 bonus to both AC and to hit and may attack with either weapon.  See Fighting with Two Weapons for the normal rules.

## Spellcasting Traits

### Changed Traits

#### Flexible Ritualist
removed

#### Potent Magic
This character picks two spells that she already knows.  Saving Throws to resist these spells are rolled with Disadvantage.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different spells each time.

#### Skilled Caster
After a great deal of practice, this character has mastered a particular type of magic. Choose two  spells known by the character; this mage gains +5 on all invocation rolls for the spells in question.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different spells each time.

#### Touched by Magic
Some have a wild, untrained gift for Magic; others learn just a bit and then do not continue their studies.  Pick two Cantrips or 1 Spell.  This character can now cast them.  She has 2 Invocation Dice with which to invoke these spells. Any spell cast using this trait must always cast at its base rank.  This Trait does nothing for spellcasting classes.  This trait may be taken multiple times to learn additional magic but no additional Invocation Dice are gained.

#### Ultimate Enchantment
removed

#### War Wizard
Through martial training and practice, your mage has learned how best to harness the destructive powers of magic. He may add his Ability Modifier to the damage of any spell or cantrip he casts.  The Ability Modifier used is the one named by the magical art itself.

### New Traits

#### By Will Alone
This character picks a single spell or cantrip.  When casting this magic, she may forgo the Gestures and Incantations requirement of the magic.  Any ingredient requirements must still be met.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different spell or cantrip each time.

#### Supreme Concentration
This character may concentrate on 2 spells at the same time.  If an event will potentially break her concentration, she must make a concentration check for each spell.

### New Traits

#### Beast Speech
Whether because of heritage, a mystical pact, or an unknown gift, this character has a great affinity with a particular type of animal (felines, canines, serpents, birds, etc). She may speak with them, has a rough sense of when they are nearby, and gains a +2 on any Charisma rolls involving them.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different animal type each time.

#### Elemental Caller
Select a particular elemental type (earth, air, fire or water) when this trait is selected.  Due to bloodline or oath, all manifested or aware elementals of the named type in Near range of your character must present themselves; socially if they are capable of speech, or wordlessly if they are not. Your character can perceive them even if they are invisible or inaudible.  He gains the appropriate elemental language as a bonus language.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different elemental type each time.

#### Fae Touched
This character has been exposed to the magic of Faerie or has fae blood running in their veins.  They gain a +2 bonus to any Saving Throw vs magic.

Characters that are already Fae Blooded (such as Dwarves, Elves and Goblins) cannot take this trait.

#### Healing Touch
This character’s hands have the power to heal the sick and wounded. He may lay hands on another and grant them the same benefits as a Short Rest (though this does not count against the number of short rests they may take in a day).

This trait may be taken multiple times, to gain additional uses of this ability (regaining only 1 use per Long Rest).

Additionally, she may make a Charisma check for a chance that the creature’s True Name will come to her that night in a dream.  The difficulty of the check is 10 + 1 per HD or Level of the target.

#### Wilderness Friend
Pick a terrain type (such as forest, desert, ocean, mountain, etc).  This character can never become lost in this terrain except by magical means.  Additionally, sometimes the natural spirits of the land in this terrain whisper to her and she gains +2 on any CHA roll to interact with such spirits.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different terrain type each time.
