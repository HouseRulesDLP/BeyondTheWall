## Encumbrance
Any given character can only carry so much.  Some groups may wish to handwave the tracking of encumbrance and that's completely understandable.  The rules here are meant to provide some degree of verisimilitude without having to track pounds and ounces of carried gear and treasure.

Encumbrance is tracked in Items or Slots (the terms are used interchangeably in these rules).  A single Item is any object that can be carried in hand reasonably comfortably (a sword, a torch, a lute, etc).  Larger objects, take up at least 2 Slots (or more for even larger objects; like a full treasure chest).  Worn clothing does not count as an Item, but carried clothing does.  Small items (such as coins) do not count as an Item unless they are carried in bulk (such as 100 coins counting as 1 Item). 

Additionally, some equipment may be bundled to reduce the number of Slots it takes up (such as a bundle of 7 Rations only taking up 2 Slots).  These bundles require an Action to break apart for use after which the individual objects making up the bundle must be tracked separately.

### Readied Items
Each character may carry a number of Readied Items equal to half their Strength Score, rounded up.  Readied Items are those items on hand for immediate use without needing to take an Action to unpack them.  This includes things like worn armor, carried shields and weapons and any other item the character wishes to be able to access quickly an easily.

### Stowed Items
Stowed Items are those packed away and carefully organized to be as compact as possible.  To carry any Stowed Items, a character must have a backpack, sack or similar thing in which to carry these items.  If so equipped, a character can carry as many Stowed Items as their Strength Score.

### Excessive Encumbrance
These limits represent the amount of gear a character can carry without penalty.  An extra 2 Readied Items or 4 Stowed Items (or fractions thereof), reduces a character's Movement by 5 feet and they take a -2 penalty on all Strength and Dexterity Checks.  Additionally, for every hour so encumbered, they must make a Constitution Check vs a Difficulty of 12 or gain a level of Exhaustion.  Going further beyond this limit; up to 4 Readied Items or 8 Stowed Items, reduces the character's movement to half, increases the Strength and Dexterity check penalties to -4 and increases the Exhaustion check difficulty to 15.

## Coinage
Every petty king and warlord seems to issue their own form of currency. Below is a table listing those coin types most commonly found with sample regional names. Most peasants and commoners deal in barter, but whey they do have coin, it is typically copper or (occasionally) silver. Silver is typically the coin of merchants and other 'middle-class' folk. Higher value coins are rarely seen by the peasantry; mostly being used by wealthy merchants and nobles.

Even rarer still are ancient coins, gems, jewelry and the like. Their value varies greatly by their rarity and quality.

The entries on the coinage table are far from the only materials used for money. Some regions may use wood, bone, ivory or even more unusual materials. Exchanges between countries is a matter of material value and diplomatic relations.

| Coin     | Abbreviation | Name*   | Value  | Real World Equivalent |
|:---------|:------------:|:-------:|:------:|----------------------:|
| Copper   | cp           | Peasant | 1/10sp | $1.00                 |
| Silver   | sp           | Common  |    1sp | $10.00                |
| Electrum | ep           | Knight  |    5sp | $50.00                |
| Gold     | gp           | Noble   |   10sp | $100.00               |
| Platinum | pp           | Royal   |  100sp | $1,000.00             |

* Other realms will have their own names for equivalent coins.

## Quality
The equipment table prices in this chapter assume items of common quality.  Higher or lower quality work can dramatically affect these prices.  The exact game effect of different quality items is often left up to the GM to determine on a case-by-case basis.  For example, a poor quality sword may be judged to have a -1 to hit chance, while a superior quality sword may increase it’s damage die by 1 step.  It is recommended that weapon quality modifiers be limited to no more than +/- 1 on to-hit or damage, or a 1 die step for damage.  Higher quality weapons might have multiple such properties (such as a master-crafted bow being +1 to hit, +1 die step damage and +10% range).

| Quality | Cost Multiplier |
|:--------|:---------------:|
| Poor | 0.5 |
| Common | 1 |
| Excellent | 2 |
| Superior | 4 |
| Master/Luxury | 10 |

## Rarity
Not all items are equally available in all regions.  As a result, the GM is encouraged to multiply the cost of an item based on how common or rare it is.  The recommended range is the same as for Quality Modifiers above (x0.5 to x10).

## Haggling
It is possible that your players may wish to haggle with local merchants over the cost of items (especially for those with quality or rarity modifiers).  This can be handled with a simple roll on the Reaction Table (see Rolling the Dice) modified by the bartering character’s Charisma Modifier.  Below are some suggestions on how to interpret the results:

| Reaction Check Result | Effect |
|:---|:---|
| Hostile | The merchant is insulted and throws the character out of their shop.  If they have any influence in the community, they may consider blacklisting the character with other merchants. |
| Unfriendly | The merchant not only refuses to haggle, but increases the price by (1d4+1)x10%. |
| Neutral | The merchant is potentially willing to make a compromise deal, changing their price by (2d4-5)x5% [-15% to +15%] |
| Indifferent | The merchant agrees to reduce their price by up to 30%. |
| Friendly | The character has won the merchant over to such a degree that they’re willing to offer a ‘friends and family’ discount, cutting their price by up to 50%. |

If the characters have no intent to haggle, simply forego any haggling rolls and use the price as listed (modified by quality and rarity as normal).

## Weapons
The weapon tables below are not meant to be exhaustive, but represent those most commonly found in a typical western-style fantasy campaign.  For more exotic weaponry from far off lands, it’s often easiest to simply find an equivalent entry on one of the below tables and modify it’s stats based on quality and rarity.  For example, a katana could be interpreted as a _rare_ _excellent_-quality arming sword (+1 to hit, x4 cost).

### Weapon Properties
- **2H**: This weapon requires 2 hands to wield.
- **Defensive**: Wielding this weapon with proficiency grants the user +1 AC in melee.
- **Finesse**: When used in melee, this weapon may use either Dexterity or Strength for attack and damage bonuses.
- **Flexible**: This weapon ignores the target's AC bonus from shields and weapons with the Defensive property.
- **Hurlant**: This weapon may be thrown to a range of Near using either Strength or **Dexterity** for attack and damage bonuses.
- **Impact**: On a Critical Hit, the garget must make a Strength Check (difficulty = damage taken) or suffer the effects of a Shove Maneuver.
- **Mounted**: This weapon requires 2-hands when used on foot, but only 1 hand when mounted. Additionally, it does double damage on a mounted Charge Maneuver.
- **Reach**: This weapon can be used for melee attacks against targets out to 10ft and can be used from the 2nd rank.
- **Reload**: This weapon must be reloaded after each use, requiring an Action.
- **Snare**: A large or smaller creature hit by this weapon is Restrained. A restrained creature may spend an Action to attempt a Dexterity Check vs a Difficulty equal to the Attack Roll total to escape.  Alternatively, a Difficulty 15 Strength Check may be attempted to break the ensnaring weapon.
- **Versatile**: This weapon may be wielded with either 1 or 2 hands.  If 2 hands are used, roll damage with Advantage.  Small creatures using this weapon one-handed have Disadvantage on their Attack Rolls.  If they use 2 hands they do not roll damage with Advantage.

### Damage Types
- **(B)lunt**
- **(P)iercing**
- **(S)lashing**

If a weapon lists 2 or more damage types, the wielder must specify the damage type they are using when they make the attack.  If not specified, the first listed type will be assumed.

### Weight
- **(L)ight**: Anyone can use these weapons in their off-hand.
- **(M)edium**: No special notes.
- **(H)eavy**: Small creatures have Disadvantage when wielding weapons with this tag.

### Ranges
- **(C)lose**: 5 feet - Weapons with a max range of Far or further have Disadvantage at this range.
- **(N)ear**: 30 feet
- **(F)ar**: 150 feet - Attacks made at this range or further have Disadvantage.
- **(S)ight**: Within Line of Sight (LoS).
- **(D)istant**: Beyond perception.

## Armor
The armor list below should be considered as general categories of armor rather than a definitive list.  There are too many types of armor in both history and fantasy to create a truly exhaustive list and, instead, armor should be associated with its nearest category to determine it’s game mechanics.

Like other items, armor quality can vary.  It is generally recommended that any one characteristic not be modified by more than one step better or worse.  Qualities higher than Good should simply modify multiple characteristics.

### Armor Properties
- **1H**: Requires the use of 1 hand.
- **Category**: This is the armor category noted for proficiency purposes 
	- (L)ight, (M)edium, (H)eavy, (B)uckler and (S)hield.
- **Encumbering**: Reduces movement by 5ft (for Medium armor) or 10ft (for Heavy armor).  Also for every 1 minute of intense activity (such as combat), make a Constitution check vs DT 12 (Medium) or 15 (Heavy) or gain 1 level of Exhaustion.
- **Noisy**: Imposes Disadvantage on stealth checks.
- **DEX Mod**: This is the amount of your Dexterity Modifier (round up) that may be added to your AC.  If your Dexterity modifier is negative, always apply the full value.

### Armor List
| Type | Category | Base AC | DEX Mod | Cost | Slots | Properties |
|:-----|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|-----:|:-----:|:-----------|
| Cloth / Leather  | L | +1 | Full |    10sp | 1 | -- |
| Hardened Leather | L | +2 | Full |    20sp | 1 | -- |
| Ringmail         | M | +3 | Half |   150sp | 2 | Noisy |
| Scalemail        | M | +4 | Half |   300sp | 2 | Noisy, Encumbering |
| Chainmail        | M | +5 | Half |   600sp | 2 | Noisy, Encumbering |
| Reinforced Chain | H | +6 | Zero | 1,000sp | 3 | Noisy, Encumbering |
| Lamellar         | H | +7 | Zero | 2,000sp | 3 | Noisy, Encumbering |
| Plate            | H | +8 | Zero | 3,000sp | 3 | Noisy, Encumbering |
| Buckler          | B |  # | --   |    10sp | 1 | 1H |
| Shield           | S |  % | --   |    20sp | 1 | 1H |

<sub>
# Grants +3 AC with no armor, +2 with Light armor, +1 with Medium and +0 with Heavy.<br/>
% Grants +4 AC with no armor, +3 with Light, +2 with Medium and +1 with Heavy.
</sub>

For creatures that are not Medium in size, the cost of armor is modified: For small creatures, costs are halved.  For creatures of Large size or greater, the cost doubles per size category larger than Medium.  The Slot values are not adjusted.

### Donning and Doffing Armor
It takes time to don (put on) or doff (take off) armor.  You only benefit from armor's AC bonus once it is fully on (after the full donning time).  These times are halved with a competent assistant (excepting shields).

| Category         | Don        | Doff      |
|:-----------------|-----------:|----------:|
| Light            | 1 minute   | 1 minute  |
| Medium           | 5 minutes  | 1 minute  |
| Heavy            | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Buckler / Shield | 1 action   | 1 action  |

## Gear
This is a list of common adventuring gear, much of which can be found in various general stores throughout the land.  Some specialized items (such as acid, alchemist’s fire, poisons and the like) will only be available at specialty shops like alchemy shops, herbalists and so forth.

|  Item                       |  Cost   |  Slots  |  Properties                                                                                                                  |

When in need of proper accommodations, the table below gives the cost for average examples of the normal food and service obtainable.

| Inn Stay |  1sp | 1 day; common quality counts toward a modest Lifestyle. |

### Mounts, Livestock and Transport 
Be it as a beast of burden, means of transportation or just some extra protection and companionship, a well-trained animal can be a valuable asset.  The speed given in the table below is the animal’s combat speed.  The carry value is the encumbrance value worth of gear an animal can carry.  A rider typically counts as 3 encumbrance for small creatures, 6 for medium and 10 or more for large creatures.  Also take into account the gear the rider is wearing and carrying.

Animals can typically drag/pull five times their carry if otherwise unburdened.

### Drawn Vehicles
Sometimes you want to travel in style.  The prices below are to outright own a given vehicle.  The temporary loan of a vehicle is typically 10% of the cost per day, with 1/4 to 1/2 the purchase cost as a down payment.

Encumbrance is in **Slots** when the vehicle is being pulled and does not account for items in the vehicle.  A drawn vehicle's max capacity is equal to its own Encumbrance.

## Lifestyle Expenses
Between adventures your character needs to be able to rest and heal.  Doing so in style costs money.  The table below lists the daily price to maintain a particular lifestyle.  Each lifestyle rank, aside from Modest, can impact your character’s social interactions and how well they can rest and heal.

A **Squalid** lifestyle basically means the character is homeless and penniless.  Others, even others living in squalid conditions, will look down on your filthy hygiene and ragged appearance.  As a result you have Disadvantage on any checks for social interaction.  Additionally, you must pass at difficulty 15 Constitution Check to recover any levels of Exhaustion.

A **Poor** lifestyle is one of labor and hardship as you struggle to keep food on the table and a roof over your head.  The hard work of this lifestyle means you need to pass a difficulty 12 Constitution Check to recover any levels of Exhaustion.

A **Modest** lifestyle is that of the average commoner.  You have plenty of food and shelter, plus even some free time to enjoy yourself.  This lifestyle has no particular benefits, but no downsides either.

A **Wealthy** lifestyle affords the finer foods and lodging, as well as the opportunity to attend or throw the occasional party.  The extra rest and comfort allows you to roll one extra Hit Die whenever you heal.

With an **Aristocratic** lifestyle, you’re practically one of the nobility (even if not, in fact, a noble).  You are able to afford the best of everything and not only do you enjoy the same healing benefits as the Wealthy, others also look up to you.  Your finery and status grant you Advantage on any social interaction checks.

| Lifestyle    | Cost | Notes |
|:-------------|-----:|:------|
| Squalid      |  0sp | Disadvantage on social checks.  Must pass a diff 15 CON Check to recover Exhaustion. |
| Poor         |  2cp | Must pass a diff 12 CON Check to recover Exhaustion. |
| Modest       |  2sp | -- |
| Wealthy      |  8sp | Roll +1 HD when healing. |
| Aristocratic | 20sp | Roll +1 HD when healing.  Advantage on social checks. |
