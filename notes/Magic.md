# Runes
Runes empower magic.

Each mage begins knowing Charisma Modifier (minimum 1) runes.  More must be discovered in play.

# Formula
Formula are used to control magic.  These are the individual spells a mage knows.  Formula are combined with Runes to create a specific effect.  The rune used will determine things like damage type and target type.  The formula used will determine other aspects of the spell.

# Caster
The caster is the final fundamental ingredient of magic.  Casters empower a spell via their Invocation Dice.

# Example Spells

## Spark
- Rank: 0 (cantrip)
- Required Rune(s): any with a damage type
- Casting Ability: Intelligence
- Casting Time: 1 Action
- Range: Close
- Area: 1 Creature/Object
- Duration: Instant
- Save: none
- Components: Gestures and Incantations
By means of this spell, the caster uses the power of a rune in a destructive manner.  When this spell is cast, the mage selects the empowering rune (and damage type) of the spell.  At it's minimum, this spell does negligible damage, but can produce utilitarian effects (such as using the Fire rune to ignite a torch).  Alternatively, the mage may use this as an attack (requiring a magical attack vs an unwilling target), doing 1d4 damage of the selected type.

The range of this spell may be increased 1 category per +1 Rank (up to a maximum of Far).

The number of targets may be increased by 1 per +1 Rank.

The damage may be increased by 1 die type per +1 Rank.

## Mend
- Rank: 0 (cantrip)
- Required Rune(s): the rune associated with the target type
- Casting Ability: Wisdom
- Casting Time: 1 Action
- Range: Touch
- Area: 1 Creature or a Tiny area
- Duration: Instant
- Save: none
- Components: Gestures and Incantations
By means of this spell, the mage uses the power of a rune to heal or mend a given object.  The rune selected when casting this spell must match the target type (Body for healing a person, Earth to mend a stone wall, etc).

If used to heal a living being, this spell will heal the target's CON modifier (minimum 1) in HP.  For each +1 Rank added, increase the healing by 1 of the target's Hit Dice.  The number of creatures healed may be increased by +1 per +1 Rank.

If used on an inanimate object, 1 Tiny area of material will be made whole.  This area may be increased by 1 category per +1 rank.  Thus, to mend a cut rope, the mage would apply the Earth rune (for the plant material) at rank zero.  To mend a 10x10x5 foot section of castle wall (500 cubic feet) would require casting the spell at Rank 3 (for a Large area of effect).

The range of this spell may be increased 1 step per +1 Rank (max Far).
