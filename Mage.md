- **Hit Dice:** d6
- **Initiative Bonus:** +0
- **Weapons:** Light
- **Armor:** Light

## Starting Equipment

- 4d6sp

## Class Abilities
As given in the core rules plus the following:

- **Spell Casting:** Spell casting works very different than in the core rules.  Each mage gains a number of Invocation Dice equal to their level plus their Wisdom Modifier.  These dice are used in casting spells (see the Sorcerous Arts section).  Mages may not cast a spell of a rank higher than 1/2 their level (rounded up).
- **Magical Focus:** As part of your apprenticeship, you created a unique magical focus to aid in your spell casting. This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held. It also takes up 1 inventory slot. So long as you have your Magical Focus in hand when casting a spell, you roll d8s for your Invocation Dice instead of d6s. A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a safe haven and 500sp worth of materials.
