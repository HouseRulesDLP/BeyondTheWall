## Class Abilities
As given in the core rules plus the following:

### Battle Maneuvers
Once per turn, when you make a melee attack, you may attempt a Battle Maneuver.  Describe the special effect you wish to add to your attack (such as disarming an opponent, tripping them, pushing them back, etc).  If the attack hits, and the die face is equal to or greater than your Battle Maneuver target number, the maneuver succeeds.  Note that the Battle Maneuver cannot add to the damage of the attack and the target may be allowed a Saving Throw.

### Hauler
Add your Constitution Modifier (if positive) to both your Stowed and Ready equipment lists.

### Minimum Damage
Warriors are experts at dealing damage.  If your attack misses the target's AC by less than your level, you still deal your attack's minimum damage to the target.

### Knacks
Knacks are now gained at every odd level (reflected on the table below).  In addition to the listed set of knacks, the following list of knacks has also been added.  Unlike the knacks in the book, these may only be taken once each.
- **Archer:** Attacking at Far range does not cause you Disadvantage on the attack.
- **Berserk:** For the duration of one combat, gain +2 on Strength Checks, melee Attack Rolls, melee Damage Rolls and Will saves but suffer a -4 to AC.  After combat ends, gain a level of Exhaustion.  You cannot use this knack while you have any levels of Exhaustion.
- **Cavalry:** While mounted, you gain +1 to hit and +2 damage.  Additionally, whatever creature you are mounted on gains +1 AC and +1 to its Morale.
- **Cleave:** Immediately after one of your attacks drops a foe to 0 hit points, you may make another attack. If you have movement remaining, you may move between attacks.
- **Great Weapon Fighter:** When wielding a Heavy 2-handed weapon, any damage dice that show a 1 or 2 may be re-rolled.  Use the higher result.
- **Mighty Shot:** You may use your Battle Maneuvers ability with ranged attacks.
- **Shield Master:** While using this ability, you may add your shield bonus to your Reflex saves.  You also increase your AC bonus from shields by +1.
