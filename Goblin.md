# Goblin
**AKA**: Luton, Skreetok<br/>
Goblins are a species of naturally nocturnal fae humanoids most commonly found in the woods and mountains.  They stand 4 to 5 feet in height, have pointed ears, cat-like eyes, sharp teeth, long arms and spare or patchy body hair.  Their skin tones are some shade of gray, red, yellow or green.  They typically stand between 4 and 5 feet in height and have a lifespan rarely exceeding 50 years.

  Their features are superficially similar to those of Orcs, causing some to believe that the species are related but neither Orcs nor Goblins consider this to be true.

## Features
### Fey Blooded
Due to their inherently magical nature, goblins gain a +2 bonus on all Saving Throws vs magic.
### Low-Light Vision
Goblins see in dim light nearly as well as full daylight; however, this vision is shades of gray only, so color cannot be discerned in these conditions.  Also, this ability does not function in full darkness.
### Small Stature
Being small hurts in a fight. You are a small creature and have Disadvantage wielding any weapon with the Heavy property, or when wielding a Versatile weapon one-handed.

On the other hand, you gain a +2 bonus on all Stealth checks.
### True Name
As fae creatures, goblins have True Names, and those with the knowledge may use an goblinâ€™s true name against her. By calling out the true name, a character gains Advantage on all actions taken against the goblin, attacks and saving throws.
