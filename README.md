# BeyondTheWall
My house rules for Beyond the Wall and Other Adventures

## Optional Rules
We will be using the following rules from Through Sunken Lands (pg 47).

### Simplified Saving Throws
The class tables have been updated to reflect the use of these saving throws.<br/>
These values are further modified by the character's Ability Score Modifiers.
- **Fortitude:** use the highest of Strength or Constitution.
- **Reflex:** use the highest of Dexterity or Intelligence.
- **Will:** use the highest of Wisdom or Charisma

### Always Roll High

### Combat Options

#### Stances
- **Normal Stance:** unchanged
- **Aggressive Stance:** +2 to hit, opponents attacking the character do so with Advantage.
- **Defensive Stance:** Attack with Disadvantage, gain +2 AC.
- **Protective Stance:** Gain +2 AC but may not attack.  If the character being protected is attacked, the attack has Disadvantage.
- **Commanding Stance:** May not attack.  Opponents attack the commanding character with Advantage.  On a successful Charisma/Leadership check, all allies who can see and hear her gain +2 to hit for the Round.

#### Fighting with Two Weapons
Replace the rules in the book with the following:<br/>
In order to wield 2 weapons, the weapon in the character’s primary hand must be a light or medium one-handed weapon, and the weapon in their off-hand must be a light one-handed weapon.

A character wielding two weapons has the option of using their off-hand weapon offensively or defensively.  This choice is made at the beginning of the character’s turn.  If the weapon is being used offensively, the character gains a +1 to hit bonus and may choose to strike with either weapon (not both).  If the weapon is being used defensively, the character gains a +1 AC bonus and may only attack with their primary weapon.

Under no circumstances is a character allowed to attack with both weapons at the same time.  However, if a character has multiple attacks per Combat Turn, then they may choose which weapon to strike with each time they make an attack.

See the Off-Hand Proficiency trait for additional rules.
