## Class Abilities

### Highly Skilled
Rogue-Mages receive 1 extra Skill at 1st level.  They gain additional skills as shown in the table below.

### Spell Casting 
Each rogue-mage gains a number of Invocation Dice based on their level plus their Wisdom Modifier.  These dice are used in casting spells (see the Sorcerous Arts section).  Rogue-Mages may not cast a spell of a rank higher than shown in the table below.

### Magical Focus
As part of your apprenticeship, you created a unique magical focus to aid in your spell casting. This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held. It also takes up 1 inventory slot. So long as you have your Magical Focus in hand when casting a spell, you roll d8s for your Invocation Dice instead of d6s. A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a safe haven and 500sp worth of materials.

### Knacks
Each knack may only be chosen once unless specified otherwise.
- **Fortune's Favor:** Gain 1 extra Fortune Point.
- **Light Footed:** Gain +10ft movement and move at full speed with no penalty to stealth so long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor.
- **Second Story Work:** So long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor, your movement is not slowed when climbing or walking along narrow surfaces. Additionally, you take half damage from falls if you pass an Evasion Saving Throw at -1 per 5 feet fallen.
- **Skulker:** While in dim lighting conditions, you have Advantage on stealth checks. Additionally, dim lighting does not impose Disadvantage on your own perception checks.
- **Watchful:** So long as you are conscious, you have Advantage on perception rolls to spot an ambush and you are never considered “unaware” of attacks.
